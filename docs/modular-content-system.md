# Modular Content System  

To facilitate easier content creation and modability, all content will be managed externally from Unity and loaded dynamically.

There are 3 types of content:
1. Starpoint Objects
2. Starpoint Resources
3. Starpoint Effects

These are stored in, respectively:
1. Starpoint Object Libraries (.SOLs)
2. Starpoint Resource Libraries (.SRLs)
3. As a part of Starpoint objects in SOLs


These are managed and edited by, respectively (you guessed it):
1. SOLM (SOL Manager)
2. SRLM (SRL Manager)
